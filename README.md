📚 Database Projects Portfolio
Hi, I'm Varshitha Sagar, a first-year student at NIAT, and this repository showcases five database projects I’ve built as part of my learning journey in database systems. Each project demonstrates real-world applications of core database concepts such as ER modeling, normalization, SQL querying, and data management using relational databases.

🛠️ Skills & Tools Used
SQL – Query language for all data operations

MySQL – Main RDBMS used for implementation

pgAdmin / SQLite – Used for testing and comparisons

ER Diagrams – Designed using Draw.io and DBMS tools

Normalization – Applied up to 3rd Normal Form (3NF)

Stored Procedures & Triggers – For automation and logic control

Views – For role-based data access

📦 Folder Structure
Each project has its own folder and includes:

SQL script for schema and sample data

ER diagram or schema image

Sample queries for testing

Individual README with project-specific details

📌 What I Learned
How to design clean, efficient, and scalable relational databases

Writing complex SQL queries for various data operations

Applying real-world logic to data management problems

Using tools like MySQL Workbench and pgAdmin effectively
